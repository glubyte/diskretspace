Diskretspace is written in C and Assembly and compiled by GCC 6.3.0.

External libraries include:
Vulkan 1.0.49
SDL 2.0.5
FreeType 2.8

It runs natively on the Linux kernel and supports the Xlib, Wayland, and Mir window managers.
Windows is supported, although lacks the degree of optimization on Linux. However, this shouldn't be very noticeable with a decent GPU. 
Mac is not and never will be supported.

It was designed and tested on an Nvidia GTX 1070. Thus, performance hits and strange behaviors are to be expected outside of the vulkan-compatible nvidia lines.

Basic shell knowledge is useful.
